## Features

- ⚡ **Bluetooth BLE Control** – Send commands from a custom mobile app
- 👣 **Tap-to-Trigger Animations** – Tactile button for foot-based activation
- 🎨 **Color Customization** – Change RGB values in real time
- 💡 **Animations**
  - `Fade`: Fades the whole strip from the selected color
  - `Converge`: Colored dots move from both ends and meet in the center
  - `Rainbow`: Flowing multicolor effect
  - `Solid Rainbow`: Uniform rainbow cycling across the strip
- 🔋 Runs on a rechargeable **1000mAh Li-Po battery**
- 🛠️ Built using **Arduino IDE** and **MIT App Inventor**

## App Control (MIT App Inventor)

The mobile controller was built using [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).  
It communicates with the ESP32 via **BLE** and sends simple command strings.

### BLE Command Reference:

| Command       | Function                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `1`           | Trigger `fade()` animation            |
| `2:<0–100>`   | Set brightness (0–100%)               |
| `3:(R,G,B)`   | Set RGB color (e.g. `3:(255,0,255)`)  |
| `4`           | Enable flowing rainbow mode           |
| `5`           | Enable solid rainbow mode             |
| `6`           | Trigger `converge()` animation        |

## Planned Upgrades

The Yamixen Spiritlight project is still evolving. The current version is a working prototype, but several exciting upgrades are already planned to take it to the next level:

- **Pressure-Based Activation**: Replace the tactile switch with a **piezo sensor** or **force-sensitive resistor**
- **Battery Level Monitoring**: Display battery percentage via BLE
- **Advanced Animation Patterns**: More visual effects and programmable modes
- **Improved App Interface**: Smoother UI with real-time color previews
- **3D-Printed Integration**: Modular design with **3D-printed sole/housing**
- **Refined Wiring & Mounting**: Better internal layout using flexible wires
