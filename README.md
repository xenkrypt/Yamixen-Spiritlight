## App Control (MIT App Inventor)

The mobile controller was built using [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).  
It communicates with the ESP32 via **BLE** and sends simple command strings.

### BLE Command Reference:

| Command       | Function                              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `1`           | Trigger `fade()` animation            |
| `2:<0‚Äì100>`   | Set brightness (0‚Äì100%)               |
| `3:(R,G,B)`   | Set RGB color (e.g. `3:(255,0,255)`)  |
| `4`           | Enable flowing rainbow mode           |
| `5`           | Enable solid rainbow mode             |
| `6`           | Trigger `converge()` animation        |

## Arduino Code Overview

- Written in **Arduino IDE**
- Uses `Adafruit_NeoPixel` for LED control
- Uses `BLEDevice`, `BLEUtils`, `BLEServer` for Bluetooth communication
- Maintains a current mode state and RGB color variables
- Supports both BLE input and tactile button control

## Planned Upgrades

The Yamixen Spiritlight project is still evolving. The current version is a working prototype, but several exciting upgrades are already planned to take it to the next level:

- **Pressure-Based Activation**: Replace the tactile switch with a **piezo sensor** or **force-sensitive resistor**
- **Battery Level Monitoring**: Display battery percentage via BLE
- **Advanced Animation Patterns**: More visual effects and programmable modes
- **Improved App Interface**: Smoother UI with real-time color previews
- **3D-Printed Integration**: Modular design with **3D-printed sole/housing**
- **Refined Wiring & Mounting**: Better internal layout using flexible wires
